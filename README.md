# Background (Terry v. Ohio):
In 1967 three men were stopped by a policeman described to be in plain clothes. This stop resulted in the officer frisking the men based on his belief that they were suspicious and led him to find weapons on two out of three of the men. It was argued that this stop violated the men’s Fourth Amendment right which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizure by the government. In an 8 to 1 decision it was deemed by the court that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment. 

# The problem:
In the fifty plus years since this case, people have been more concerned with police abuse of power and not having individual rights respected. Oftentimes, laws seem more black and white, or binary, but when a case is to be heard by a judge or jury emotions can get thrown into the mix for better or worse which can introduce bias. 

The goal of this analysis is to limit the amount of bias and have a machine classifier be the judge of whether these recorded stops infringed on a person’s Fourth Amendment right. With this information further analysis will be done to determine how big of a role race and gender plays in, as well as if there is an increase or decrease in occurrences based on time and day.
